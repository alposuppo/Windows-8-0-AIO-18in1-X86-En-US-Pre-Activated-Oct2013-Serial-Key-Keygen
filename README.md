- VL: The edition that uses Volume License activation, suitable for large organizations that have a volume licensing agreement with Microsoft.
- Pro with Media Center: The edition that includes Windows Media Center, a feature that allows users to watch and record TV shows, play DVDs, and access other media content.
- Enterprise: The edition that includes all the features of Pro, plus additional features such as Windows To Go, AppLocker, and BranchCache, suitable for large enterprises that need advanced security and management capabilities.

The difference between x86 and x64 is the architecture of the processor. x86 refers to the 32-bit processors, while x64 refers to the 64-bit processors. The main advantage of x64 is that it can support more than 4 GB of RAM, while x86 is limited to that amount. However, x64 also requires more disk space and memory than x86.
